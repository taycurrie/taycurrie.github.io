  Hi my name is Jeffrey I am a 26 year old former contractor looking to switch over to coding after several life and family accidents/injuries.  I have had a little experience with code between video game modding and some crypto bots. given this experience with modding in high school I have been interested in coding since but at the end of that summer before collage had a football injury take me out for a year. at one point a few years ago had almost gone into GA but then had a major injury taking me out of work fallowed by a family loss that made it impossible at the time. 
   
	 Fallowing my job ending for the winter this fall I was kinda interested in flatiron but was worried to get started and ran through this app career karama (which is free) that has a good community to learn from and be guided into what bootcamp/school to go with and I would definitely recommend them to anyone starting out as they try to get you into good habits for when camp starts. 
   
	 Now that the first mile is ending I am happy to have finally started something I have been thinking about doing on and off for years and even though it is just the start it definitely feels good to finally be dealing with these sorts of challenges that are interesting and keep you thinking but relatively low risk compared to my past jobs. Very much looking forward to getting into the field and getting started even though there is still a long way to go and this is just the start of the journey.
